Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e
```

Explanation:

'e' is the letter that was added.


#### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        map<char, int> s_map;
        for (auto c : s) s_map[c]++;
        for (auto c : t) {
            if (s_map[c] <= 0) return c;
            s_map[c]--;
        }
        return 'x';
    }
};
```


```cpp
// Solution 2, same idea with 136
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        char sum = 0;
        for (auto c : s) sum ^= c;
        for (auto c : t) sum ^= c;
        return sum;
    }
};
```
